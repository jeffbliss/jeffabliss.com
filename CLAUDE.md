- Prefer declarative patterns and state-driven rendering
- Use functional components with hooks

### UI Components
- Use Material UI components exclusively
- Follow Material Design principles
- Maintain consistent theming throughout the application

### Claude Code Workflow
- Use Claude Code for component generation and refactoring
- Leverage AI assistance for Material UI implementation
- Document AI-assisted development patterns

## Presentation Structure

### Phase 1: Claude Code Demo
- Show how Claude Code assists with React development
- Demonstrate AI-powered component creation
- Highlight Material UI integration capabilities

### Phase 2: Appalachian Trail Content
